# ML-Assignment
First big assignment for Intro to ML course in Innopolis
## Short description:
Assignment to apply some of Machine Learning techniques on practice. Through the work you will see usage of: Linear Regression, Polynomial regression, Polynomial Regression Pipeline, GridSearch for tuning the hyper-parameter, data preprocessing, data encoding, data scaling and standartization, comparison between different hyper-parameter in Logistic Regression, KNN.
## Very Important!
Rerun the whole Jupyter Notebook before checking the work! And do not forgot to change links to the data!

### The main goal of the study 
To practice the ML techniques on big and different data
### Brief information about the data
There are 4 data that been used in this project. 
Task1_data.csv is a artificially created date for our assignment. It is already split into X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test.
pokemon_modified.csv is a data with pokemon features. Main goal is to build a model for predecition whether this pokemon is legendary or not.
bonus_test.csv and bonus_train.csv is another artificially created date for our assignment for the bonus task.
### Steps to achieve the goal
1. Follow the rules and problems during the assignment
2. Write answers to all question during the notebook
